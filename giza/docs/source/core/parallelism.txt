===================
Parallel Operations
===================

Overview
--------

There are a large number of small tasks required to build a
documentation resources including: content generation, compiling a target, post
processing the target, staging resource, and uploading content to a
server. While most of these tasks are small, they all incur some cost, and
while there are dependencies and ordering requirements many of these
tasks can safely execute in parallel. While parallel execution incurs
some overhead, the overall build time is lower.

Giza contains a model for describing a concurrent build system that is
independent from the actual parallelism mechanism, this functionally,
accessible using :class:`~giza.core.app.BuildApp()` and
:class:`~giza.core.task.Task()` objects have the following features: 
       
- parallelism mechanisms are pluggable. Users can decide at runtime to
  use a different default mechanism, or to execute tasks serially.

- except for requirements related to parallelism mechanisms
  (e.g. pickle-ability,) functions do not need to be aware of the
  concurrent execution.
  
- developers can easily control the execution order of tasks.

- exceptions propagate "correctly" out of concurrent environments, and
  developers have access to the results of tasks in the order of
  task creation.

Behavior
--------

:class:`~giza.core.task.Task()` defines a single task, which you can
think of as a function call that *may* execute
concurrently. :class:`~giza.core.task.Task()` may define a file path
or paths as its target and dependency, and by default will only
execute if the/a target does not exist or if the last modification to
the dependency is more recent than the modification of the target.

:class:`~giza.core.app.BuildApp()` defines a sequence of tasks, and
contain other instances of :class:`~giza.core.app.BuildApp()`
in addition to :class:`~giza.core.task.Task()`
units. Nested :class:`~giza.core.app.BuildApp()` instance execute in
isolation with regard to tasks defined before and after the nested
:class:`~giza.core.app.BuildApp()`  instance.
