==================
Content Generation
==================

Overview
--------

Content generation with Giza tools has two primary advantages over
conventional content in-lining: ``giza`` encourages the separation of
internal and external representation with the use of structure *and*
``giza`` supports very granular content-reuse using an inheritance
metaphor.

Giza generation works by reading data from a ``yaml`` formatted text
file in the content tree, and producing reSructuredText output that
other files in the content tree can include using the in-lining
mechanism. 

While each type of files has a slightly different
structure, generally these ``yaml`` files consist of a sequence of
mappings (i.e. a list of dictionaries,) where each document in the
stream represents a unit of content,. Each content unit has a number of
fields, and can optionally *inherit* from another content unit, and
optionally override any of the top-level fields in the source
document.

The content generation runs as needed before beginning the Sphinx
portion of a build, and Giza is generally aware of the dependencies
between source files and included files, and between source files. 

Implementation
--------------

.. note:: In practice, at the time of writing, many of the content
   generators use legacy implementations that implement the
   inheritance resolution and have limited access to the build state,
   relative to the implementation described in this section. 

A content generator has a number of high level components: 

- a cache that holds all DE-serialized content, hashed by file and
  then by unique identifier (i.e. ``ref``). Having a single cache of
  all this data in one interface makes it possible to resolve
  inherited content quickly, while limiting file access. 
  
- some representation of each file-level collection of content
  object. This serves as a connector between the cache and the
  representation of each content unit, and the requirements of this
  level depend on what content will be generated. If each content unit
  is its own file, then this layer is effectively a simple list or
  sequence. If there is some relationship between source file and
  output file, or if the content units in the file have different
  structures then this layer has stronger requirements.
  
- a representation of the content unit. This layer is responsible for
  validating input content, and inferring any computed values based on
  the input content.

- a rendering layer that translates the content units into text
  files. This uses `RstCloth
  <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rstcloth>`_, which is a Python API to
  generate restructured text in Python code.

The :mod:`giza.core.implementation` module provides the base classes
that other content generators can use to provide inheritance and basic
structure.

Strategies
----------

When using the Giza-based content generation authors and editors
should write content.

- avoid references between content units.
  
- when possible, include content in top-level fields within the content
  unit document. Some formats may support some level of nesting,
  however this limits the potential for custom reuse.
  
- prefer using a larger number of smaller content units to a fewer
  number of larger content units.

Future Development
------------------

In the future, the content generation system will:

- have some system "context change" so that the build system can
  notify when the context around a reused content unit changes.
  
- legacy content generators will migrate to using the new
  infrastructure.

- improve sophistication and consistency around the edition-based
  filtering and begin to use the
  :func:`~giza.content.helper.edition_check()` operation.
        
- increased consistency about when and where the build creates
  files. Currently some generators write files to the source directly,
  while other builders write to the
  ``build/<branch>/source[-<edition>]/`` directory: in future all
  generators should write output to the ``build/`` directory.
