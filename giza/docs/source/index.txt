Giza -- Documentation Build Framework
=====================================

Giza is a collection of tools built around `Sphinx
<http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_, that coordinates assembling, building, and
deploying documentation. Giza primarily addresses the MongoDB
documentation project; however, its design is sufficiently generic to
be able to facilitate the builds of multiple documentation resources
produced at MongoDB.
